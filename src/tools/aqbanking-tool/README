This folder contains a tool for basic operations on AqBanking.

Usage:
aqbanking-tool [GLOBAL-OPTIONS] COMMAND [COMMAND-SPECIFIC-OPTIONS]

Every command may have local command line options which must follow the
command. These local arguments are described below.



Global Options
==============

This tool has global options and command-specific options.
Globals options are those before the COMMAND, command-specific options
follow the COMMAND.

[-P           ARG]     PINFILE to be used for automatic PIN lookup
                       For HBCI pins you can use the tool "aqhbci-tool" to 
                       create an empty pin file:
                       "aqhbci-tool mkpinlist -o PINFILE"
                       After that just edit the newly created file with your
                       favorite editor and insert the pins you want to use
                       automatically.




The following is a list of commands which are implemented so far.


"listaccs"
==========

This command prints a TAB separated list of currently available accounts
to stdout.


Options
-------
--bank        ARG      Bank code ("Bankleitzahl")
--account     ARG      Account number
--bankname    ARG      Bank name
--accountname ARG      Account name

Wildcards ("*") and jokers ("?") are allowed. Every missing option of those
above automatically matches any account.


Examples
--------
aqbanking-tool listaccs
aqbanking-tool listaccs --bank 28250110
aqbanking-tool listaccs --bankname "*Sparkasse*"
aqbanking-tool listaccs --account 123456



"request"
=========

This command enqueues a request for specified accounts. To actually perform
the request (i.e. send it to the bank) you will have to use the command
"exec" after "request".


Options
-------
[--bank        ARG]      Bank code ("Bankleitzahl")
[--account     ARG]      Account number
[--bankname    ARG]      Bank name
[--accountname ARG]      Account name
Wildcards ("*") and jokers ("?") are allowed. Every missing option of those
above automatically matches any account.

At least one of the following options must be specified:
[--transactions   ]      Add a request for transactions
[--balance        ]      Add a request for account balance
[--sto            ]      Add a request for standing orders

For transaction requests these options are supported in addition:
[--fromdate    ARG]      Specify the first date for which transactions are to
                         requested
[--todate      ARG]      Specify the last date for which transactions are to
                         requested


Examples
--------
aqbanking-tool request --balance
aqbanking-tool request --transactions
aqbanking-tool request --transactions --fromdate 20050501
aqbanking-tool request --transactions --fromdate 20050501 --todate 20050513
aqbanking-tool request --transactions --balance
aqbanking-tool request --transactions --balance --sto



"exec"
======

This command executes previously enqueued requests.
The results are either printed to stdout or written to a file.


Options
-------
[--ctxfile     ARG]      Specify the file to which the results are to be
                         stored. This file is needed for some other commands
                         so it is best to specify it. Defaults to stdout.


Examples
--------
aqbanking-tool exec --ctxfile result.ctx



"listtrans"
===========

This command inspects the result file from the command "exec" and dumps 
transaction statements from this file.


Options
-------
[--bank         ARG]     Bank code ("Bankleitzahl")
[--account      ARG]     Account number
[--bankname     ARG]     Bank name
[--accountname  ARG]     Account name
Wildcards ("*") and jokers ("?") are allowed. Every missing option of those
above automatically matches any account.

[--ctxfile      ARG]     The result file to be used (defaults to stdin)
[--outfile      ARG]     Name of the output file to which the transactions
                         are to be stored. Defaults to stdout.
[--exporter     ARG]     Name of the export plugin to be used for storage.
                         This defaults to "csv".
[--profile      ARG]     Name of the profile of the exporter plugin to be
                         used. Defaults to "default" (for every exporter
                         plugin a "default" profile is provided by AqBanking).

Normally the system-wide profiles (and local AqBanking profiles of the user)
are used when searching for a profile. However, with the following option
you can use you own profiles database.
[--profile-file ARG]     Optional profile database file (a GWEN_DB)


Examples
--------
aqbanking-tool listtrans --ctxfile result.ctx --outfile result.csv
aqbanking-tool listtrans --bankname "*Sparkasse*" --ctxfile result.ctx
                         --outfile result.csv
aqbanking-tool listtrans --ctxfile result.ctx --outfile result.csv
                         --profile MyOwnProfile
