/** @page P_AB_TRANSACTION_LIB AB_Transaction (lib)
This page describes the properties of AB_TRANSACTION
This type contains all important information about transactions. All text fields are in UTF-8. Please note: Since version 0.9.9.1 of AqBanking a transaction may contain splits. If an AB_TRANSACTION actually does contain splits then some variables (like

<i>
localCountry

</i>

) are stored within the AB_SPLITs rather than in AB_TRANSACTION. So your application should first check for splits and read the information (marked as

<i>
in AB_SPLIT

</i>

below) from them.
<h3>Local Account Info</h3>
<p>
This group contains information about the local account. Functions of this group are also available in AB_SPLIT, please make your application check for splits first and use the values here as a fallback.
</p>
<h3>Remote Account Info</h3>

<h3>Value</h3>
