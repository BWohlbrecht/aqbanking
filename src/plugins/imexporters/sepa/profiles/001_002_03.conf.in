# When choosing a SEPA format for the transmission of data via Fints,
# AqHBCI will consider all profiles with a priority level explicitly
# set to a non-zero value. The precedence of profiles is determined by
# the settings of priority, type and name in that order. In all cases,
# the higher value is given prefernce. The profiles shipped with this
# library have either priority 5 or no setting at all.
