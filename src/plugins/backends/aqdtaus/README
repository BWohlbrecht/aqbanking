Building AqGeldKarte
=====================


Building from the Tar File
--------------------------

#>./configure
#>make
#>make install

(the last step most probably requires you to be root)


Building from CVS
-----------------

#>make -fMakefile.cvs
#>./configure
#>make
#>make install


Building the API Documentation
------------------------------

#>make srcdoc

If you want to install a linked API documentation (which links against the
API documentations of the projects AqHBCI depends on) use this:

#>make install-srcdoc

This installs the linked doc to the path you gave to ./configure in 
 "--with-docpath=PATH". It defaults to "$HOME/apidoc".
