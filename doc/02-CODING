1. Object Orientation
=====================
In all documents concerning AqBanking the term "class" refers to modules, 
because AqBanking follows the object-orientated pragma.

Example: Functions concerning AB_TRANSACTION are inside the files
transaction.c, transaction_p.h and transaction.h and start with
AB_Transaction_Something. So AB_TRANSACTION is called a "class" inside
this document.


2. Header Files
===============

2.1 Private Header Files
------------------------
Header files ending in *_p.h are considered private header files, only to be
included by the matching *.c file. These are not installed and MUST NOT be
included by any other source file.


2.2. Library-private Header Files
---------------------------------
Header files ending in *_l.h are considered private to AqBanking.
These headers are also not installed and MUST NOT be included by any source
file outside AqBanking (even not by plugins!).


2.3. Public Header Files
------------------------
All other header files are public ones which all get installed and which are
free to be included by applications and plugins.
