2005-08-17   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Only use msgfmt --qt if the program
	supports this argument.

2005/08/17: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed *-config scripts


2005/08/16  Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri2/eri2.c
	* src/plugins/imexproters/eri2/eriformat.xml
	Changed both files to improve importing of erifiles
	according to my understanding of the eri format.
	- Added stripping of leading zeroes (and P of Postgiro)
	  in account numbers
	- Changed purpose adding system
	- Added __HandleRec4() to add purpose 6 correctly.
	- Changed in eriformat.xml purpose17_32 to CustomerReference

	
2005/08/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- more work on build system
- implemented Create function in pintan crypttoken
- improved help message of aqhbci-tool
- improved build-system: 
  - removed "eval SOMETHING" where encountered
  - no longer AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED data dirs, instead add DEFS to
    Makefile.am where the data dir is needed
- renamed plugin "pkgdatadir" to "aqbanking_datadir" which is no longer
  registered (it is private to AqBanking)


2005/08/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in AH_Provider_AddJob(): Was using the userId instead of the
  customer id
- fixed a bug in openhbci1 importer: Was not using the correct date when
  importing


2005/08/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- set the loglevel of the AqBanking logdomain according to the environment
  variable "AQBANKING_LOGLEVEL"


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.3.1beta (2005/08/12)
===========================================================================


2005-08-12   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* m4/kde3.m4, qt3.m4: If KDE or Qt is not there, only give
	warnings; the error will come in configure.ac.

	* configure.ac: Fix build system -- put the AM_CONDITIONAL macros
	always at top-level, never inside an if-branch, or else configure
	will break.

	* aqbanking.spec.in: RPM spec file updated; will create
	sub-packages for qt3, kde, gnome2, geldkarte, geldkarte-qt3, ofx,
	ofx-qt3.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.3.0beta (2005/08/11)
===========================================================================


2005/08/11: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- adapted CryptToken plugin for Pin/Tan to the latest changes in Gwen
- improved configure.ac: Now some checks are only performed if the list of
  requested backends and frontends require it (e.g. tests for GTK, QT etc)
- backported ui files to 3.2
- added a missing include in AqGeldKarte-Qt-Wizard and AqOfxConnect-Qt3-Wizard
- polished README
- added missing header files to dist


2005/08/10: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- removed cbanking stuff from aqhbci-tool (now uses the frontend "cbanking")
- changed interpretation of the second argument to AB_Banking_new(): It now
  expects the path to the data folder. The configuration file will be read
  from this data folder (new default is $HOME/.banking/settings.conf instead
  of $HOME/.aqbanking.conf). The old file is still loaded if the new file
  doesn't exist, but when writing it back the new location is used.
- added function AB_Banking_GetGlobalDataDir()
- added my own eri importer, just to test a new approach to be used in general
  for binary record-oriented file formats (to be used forthe Spanish Q43
  format)


2005-08-09  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/frontends/qbanking/banking.h: Move banking.{h,_p.h,cpp} from
	sub-library prg/ to the library itself -- this way the header is
	correctly copied to the top_builddir/header directory.


2005/08/09: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- swallowed and adapted AqHBCI-QT-Tools
- fixed QT frontend
- swallowed and adapted AqDTAUS-QT-Tools
- swallowed and adapted AqGeldKarte-QT-Tools
- adapted OFXDirectConnect plugin to latest LibOFX release (0.8.0)
- fixed library linking order in backend wizards
- swallowed last backend wizard (ofx direct connect)
- now correctly create all necessary symlinks
- improved QBanking importer dialog, progress widget and callbacks


2005/08/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- swallowed more backends (aqdtaus, aqgeldkarte, aqofxconnect)
- swallowed gtk2 frontend
- swallowed kde frontend
- created qt frontend (not tested yet)


2005-08-07  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>
	* src/plugins/backends/aqhbci/plugin/applayer/accountjobs/Makefile.am:
	Rename the jobgetstandingorders.{h,c,xml,_p.h} files to
	jobgetsto.* because of tar's file name length limitation on "make
	dist".



2005-08-06  Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri/eri.c
	- Fixed bug in finding EOF. ERI files end with
	  ^Z character after the last record in the file.
	  Changed EOF detecting in AB_ERI_ReadRecord() 
	  accordingly

	
2005/08/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- build-system: Now the symlinks for all headers are created below the folder
  "headers" in $(top_builddir)
- added frontend "cbanking" (console) (aqbanking-tool now uses this rather
  than having its own console ui files)
- swallowed AqHBCI (-> src/plugins/backends/aqhbci)


2005-08-04  Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri/eri.c
	- Changed one log message back to
	  LogLevelNotice

	
2005/08/04: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added flag AB_BANKING_INPUT_FLAGS_ALLOW_DEFAULT
- added error code AB_ERROR_DEFAULT_VALUE
- changes to eri.c: 
  - changed loglevel from Notice to Error
  - make the file fit into lines of 80 characters
- updated German bank info files
- updated APIDOC in banking.h


2005-07-31   Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri/eri.c
	Changed all the printf() call's for logging purposes
	to calls to GWEN_WaitCallback_log(). This way the messages
	go into the messagebox which is already there.


2005/07/29: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- defined AB_BANKING_PROGRESS_ONE
- now AB_Banking_ExecuteQueue calls AB_Banking_ProgressStart and -End,
  not each backend. This change has to be implemented in the backends as well.
  This is needed because otherwise if there are multiple backends involved
  in one queue execution then there will be multiple progress windows which
  is quite annoying.


2005/07/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- only call GWEN_WaitCallback_Enter() when starting a progress via 
  AB_Banking_ProgressStart()


2005-07-28   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.ac: Fix AC_CHECK_LIB usage -- it *must* have a
	ACTION_IF_FOUND or otherwise the -lLIB command is added to LIBS
	automatically.


2005-07-28   Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri/eri.c: Changed the use of
	GWEN_BufferedIO_ReadRaw() in AB_ERI_ReadRecord() to the
	use of GWEN_BufferedIO_ReadRawForced(). Changed error handling
	accordingly. Also detecting EOF exactly after a record by the use of
	the character we took already a GWEN_BufferedIO_PeekChar() to.


2005-07-27   Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri/eri.c: Changed the call
	back to GWEN_Error_GetSimpleCode() and changed the errorhandling
	in calling function accordingly. Added handling of errors not resulting
	from EOF in the eri file.


2005-07-27   Peter de Vrijer <pdevrijer@home.nl>
	* src/plugins/imexporters/eri/eri.c: Changed the call to
	GWEN_Error_GetSimpleCode() in AB_ERI_ReadRecord into a
	call to GWEN_Error_GetCode(). Really need the code without
	any regard to the severity.


2005-07-26   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/cryptmanager.c: Introduce a temporary
	password buffer to avoid pointer signedness warnings (gcc4.x)
	between AB_CryptManager_GetPin and AB_Banking_GetPin.


2005/07/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- enabled Peter de Vrijer's ERI file importer
- fixed a bug in the ERI importer (a closing curly bracket was within an
  #ifdef)


2005/07/16: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added command "import" to aqbanking-tool.
  Example of usage:
  aqbanking-tool import -c out.ctx -f testfile --importer=swift 
                        --profile=SWIFT-MT940


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.2.0 (2005/07/15)
===========================================================================


2005/07/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- updated German bank info


2005/07/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added some options to CSV im/exporter: It is now able to handle positive/
  negative marks in CSV files and modifies the amount of a transaction
  accordingly.
- added CSV profile for Mijnpostbank.nl provided by Peter deVrijer


2005/07/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added a list of datedTransfers to import/export context
- added function AB_Banking_RequestDatedTransfers()
- added request for dated transfers to aqbanking-tool


2005/07/11: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed order in LDFLAGS for parser plugins dtaus and swift


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.1.0 (2005/07/10)
===========================================================================


2005/07/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- transactionlimits: Now stringlists are no longer returned as const (making
  it easier for backends to modify them)
- fixed some bugs in base transfer job


2005/07/07: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added fields to transaction limits:
  - allowMonthly (monthly cycles allowed for standing orders)
  - allowWeekly (weekly cycles allowed for standing orders)


2005-07-05   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.ac, src/tools/aqbanking-tool/cbanking.c:
	Windows/mingw32 now has <signal.h> but is missing the actual
	functions that we use. Therefore add configure check for the
	declaration of sigprocmask() and #if accordingly.


2005/06/30: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added jobs:
  - CreateStandingOrder
  - ModifyStandingOrder
  - DeleteStandingOrder
  - CreateDatedTransfer
  - ModifyDatedTransfer
  - DeleteDatedTransfer
- updated German bank info (HBCI part)


2005/06/29: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- extended AB_TRANSACTION_LIMITS to contain limits for standing orders and
  dated transfers: Started working on standing orders and dated transfers
  (sponsored by Frank Hansen).
- very much simplified transaction-based jobs: JobSingleTransfer,
  JobSingleDebitNote and the future jobs JobCreateStandingOrder,
  JobModifyStandingOrder, JobDeleteStandingOrder, JobCreateDatedTransfer,
  JobModifyDatedTransfer and JobDeleteDatedTransfer will internally share the
  new base job JobTransferBase. 
  This is completely transparent, applications or backends won't notice this
  change.


2005/06/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added command "listbal" to aqbanking-tool. This command shows balances
  in CSV format received upon "exec" (sponsored by Robert Schneider)


2005/06/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added local command line argument "-x" to aqbanking-tool commands
  "debitnote" and "transfer". With these arguments given the queue is
  immediately executed and the result returned after enqueuing a request
  (sponsored by Oliver Doerfler)
- started adding functions for transactions (transactionfns.{c,h})
- added command line arguments for logging to AqBanking-Tool
- aqbanking-tool now uses its own log domain
- updated README of aqbanking-tool
- documentation is now installed


2005/06/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added job JobGetDatedTransfers
- improved help screen of AqBanking-Tool
- added a aqbanking-tool module which checks for a given bank code and 
  account number combination


2005/06/20: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- updated Austrian bank info files: Added address, zipcode, city etc from
  another source (Oesterreichische Nationalbank). Now we have info about
  ca 2200 Austrian banks
- added missing header checks to configure.ac
- fixed a bug in banking.h: AB_BANKING_MSG_FLAGS_SEVERITY_IS_DANGEROUS
  was missing the argument
- work on AqBanking-Tool:
  - added non-interactive mode
  - character-set for output is now adjustable via a command line switch
  - added module for debit notes


2005/06/17: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- updated German bank info files


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.12 (2005/06/14)

2005/06/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in dtaus-exporter (wrong size<256 assertion)
- added "CHARGE" field to AB_TRANSACTION
- added some fields needed for foreign transfers


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.11 (2005/05/20)
===========================================================================


2005/05/20: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- aqbanking-tool now gets installed


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.10 (2005/05/20)
===========================================================================


2005/05/17: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- adapted plugin description files to latest changes in gwen
- fixed DTAUS plugin description: currently there is no export function


2005/05/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added functions
  - AB_ImExporterContext_toDb()
  - AB_ImExporterContext_fromDb()
  - AB_ImExporterAccountInfo_dup()
  - AB_ImExporterAccountInfo_toDb()
  - AB_ImExporterAccountInfo_fromDb()
  - AB_AccountStatus_List_dup()
- added command line tool which allows some basic operations (aqbanking-tool)
- added a README for aqbanking-tool
- added transfer list to ImExporterAccountInfo
- AB_Banking_GatherResponses() now also samples transfers (including
  single transfer, debit note, EU transfer etc)
- added module "transfer" to aqbanking-tool
- fixed README of AqBanking-Tool


2005-05-04  Andreas Degert  <ad@papyrus-gmbh.de>

	* bindings/python/_aqtypes.py: regenerated.

	* bindings/python/aqcodegen: added nested type definitions and
	enums (but as of now only nested enum definitions will work..).

	* bindings/python/__init__.py: some fixes and additions.


2005/05/02: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in ImExporter: When returning a transaction from an accountInfo
  object the transactions were falsely unlinked from the list
- added StandingOrders to ImExporter_Context
- AB_Banking_GatherResponses() now also samples standing orders
- AB_Banking_RequestTransactions(): 
  - firstDate and lastDate are now const
  - both dates are now set in the job if present
- added function AB_Banking_RequestStandingOrders()


2005/05/01: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added field "period" to AB_TRANSACTION (started to prepare for standing
  orders. To rebuild the transaction.* files you'll need the latest CVS
  version of Gwen, because only the latest typemaker version is able to
  handle enums)
- added some more fields needed for standing orders to struct AB_TRANSACTION
- added definitions for job AB_JobGetStandingOrders


2005/04/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added a function which checks whether a given IBAN is valid
- added bankinfo plugin for Switzerland (about 3,500 banks)


2005-04-25  Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: Add PluginManager for path lookup
	of loading the profiles.


2005-04-24  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: Change path lookup order to avoid
	warnings on win32.


2005/04/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in AB_ImExporter_ImportFile (found by Andreas Degert):
  Was not setting a read buffer for BIO


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.9 (2005/04/22)
===========================================================================


2005/04/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added two general purpose fields to AB_BankinfoService (used by OFX
  entries for FID and ORG)


2005/04/20: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- OFX importer now stores the account type


2005/04/19: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added function AB_Account_List2_FreeAll() to be used by backends only


2005-04-19  Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c (AB_Banking__UnlinkJobAs): On
	windows, the file descriptor has to be close before trying to
	unlink(2) a file. Maybe this is true on unix, too? Martin needs to
	check this.

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: Add PluginManager path lookup for
	ImExporter plugins. Necessary for win32.


2005-04-18  Andreas Degert  <ad@papyrus-gmbh.de>

	* bindings/python/_aqtypes.py: generated with current version of
	xml files; some comments and the BankInfo property bic got added.

	* bindings/python/aqcodegen: change decorators into syntax usable
	with python versions before 2.4.

	* bindings/python/aqcodegen: replace "print" with a function that
	writes UTF-8 encoded output as declared in the output header
	(no change in output because the text from the xml-input files is
	pure ascii; just in case this changes sometime).


2005-04-15  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.ac, bindings/python/*: Add the python bindings. They
	can be enabled by --enable-python. You need ctypes for that, see
	README, and you need to call automake --add-missing once before
	you can install the python bindings, because otherwise the file
	py-compile is missing.


2005-04-15  Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: For win32, rename(2) fails if the
	target exists. Therefore explicitly unlink(2) the target
	beforehand.


2005/04/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added bankinfo files for USA (about 24000 banks)
- all necessary bankinfo files for the generic bank info plugin are now
  provided by the AqBanking tarball (only need to be rebuilt by myself,
  and since rebuilding those files takes a long time it is best to do it
  only once)


2005/04/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in JobGetTransactions() (was storing the fromTime instead of the
  toTime)
- sped up work with bank info files. Also, bankinfo files are now stored in
  a single file which still is a simple GWEN_DB file (this might change
  later, however, for now this is faster than before and doesn't need too
  many files)
- improved Makefile regarding building of bankinfo files: Now they are only
  created once (unless changed)
- added bankinfo plugin for USA (this also lists some banks with OFX servers)


2005/04/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added generic bankinfo convenience library (to be used by bankinfo plugins)
- implemented lookup code in German bankinfo plugin: Now much information is 
  available for German banks
- added bankinfo module for Austria (few informations, though, only bank id
  and bank name)


2005/04/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- improved the SWIFT parser: Now if the tag :86: starts with a 999 which
  is not followed by a '?' this 999 is still read and skipped. In such a case
  now the 999 is not part of the purpose line.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.8 (2005/04/08)
===========================================================================


2005/04/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- the default for pinCacheEnabled changed now to FALSE. That means pins
  will only be cached while executing a job queue. Christian was right
  all along about this feature ;-) It is best to let the user always
  acknowledge online operations by entering his pin (chip cards will have
  to ask anyway). Furthermore the status of this flag is neither written nor
  read from the config file. So if an application wants this feature on it
  must set this flag after each AB_Banking_Init() explicitly.


2005/04/07: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added AB_Banking_newExtended which takes the extensions supported by the
  application as third argument.
  This will be used to check for extensions to GUI functions supported by
  the application.
  It will allow me to keep the number of callbacks small while maintaining
  binary compatibility even when introducing new flags for the existing
  GUI callbacks.
  AB_Banking_new() now calls this new function with extensions=0, so
  existing programs don't need to be recompiled.
- AQBANKING_VERSION stuff is no longer defined in config.h, this now allows
  to include "version.h" within AqBanking's source files
- added special treatment for nested progress contexts (-> first extension
  to GUI callbacks AB_Banking_ProgressStart() and AB_Banking_ProgressEnd())


2005-04-07   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* Makefile.am: Some cleanup for the translation-related rules in
	Makefile.


2005/04/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- OpenHBCI1 plugin now returns "AB_ERROR_UNKNOWN" thus flagging that a
  particular file *might* be supported (since there currently is no way to 
  make that determination for sure)
- fixed CSV-importer (now works even with non-AqMoney2-files)
- added a CSV-profile for CSV files provided by comdirect bank


2005/04/04: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- German translation completed by Jens Koerner (Thank you very much, I know
  how much work that must have been!!)
- refreshed type files generated by typemaker (fixes memory leaks)


2005-03-30   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: Use new
	PluginManager_AddPathFromWinReg for path lookup from windows
	registry.


2005/03/29: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in CSV importer
- added helper function AB_ImExporter_DateFromString()
- temporarily disabled deprecated warning until next GnuCash is released
- added blocking macro AQBANKING_NOWARN_DEPRECATED to be used by
  applications to disable these warnings in future versions (mainly to
  be used by GnuCash as requested)
- added default WaitCallback. This was formerly declared in each backend,
  but since its job - to direct WaitCallback logs to AB_Banking functions - 
  is better suited in AqBanking this class has moved here.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.7beta (2005/03/28)
===========================================================================


2005/03/29: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added type AB_TRANSACTION_LIMITS. This one is supposed to contain field
  limits for AB_TRANSACTIONs. This can be used to set some limits in a
  GUI.
- AB_JOBs which deal with transactions (like AB_Job_TypeTransfer and
  AB_Job_TypeDebitNote) now use AB_TRANSACTION_LIMITS instead of their own
  fields. Their own fields are still supported for compatibility reasons
  but are soon to be removed (as soon as the next GnuCash version is
  released)
- define macro AQBANKING_DEPRECATED (used with gcc to mark deprecated
  functions)
- added country to AB_ACCOUNT


2005/03/28: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- always use "UTC 12:00" for dates which do not contain a time. This avoids
  the problem with date shifting due to daylight saving time.
  Note: This means there is no localization of the time in the plugins
  anymore.
- switched to short dates in AB_Job_to/fromDb (makes job files smaller)


2005/03/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added function AB_JobEuTransfer_GetCountryInfoList()


2005/03/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added field to AB_TRANSACTION: remoteBankLocation


2005-03-23   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/jobs/jobeutransfer.c: Fix error in creating
	JobEuTransfer: was not setting the correct enum JobType.


2005/03/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in AB_Banking__ReadImExporterProfiles() (was trying to lock
  the profile file)
- added currency information to AB_COUNTRY. This will make it easier for me
  to implement EUR transfers (because I can now determine whether the target
  country is within the EUR zone)
- AB_TRANSACTION: preparations for EU transfers:
  - added remoteIban
  - added remoteBankName
- added job: AB_JobEuTransfer


2005/03/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug concerning pending jobs


2005-03-21   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.ac, m4/az_python.m4, bindings/Makefile.am: Put
	infrastructure for python wrappers into place.

	
2005-03-17   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/plugins/imexporters/*/Makefile.am: Fix DLLLDFLAGS for
	win32/mingw DLL building.


2005-03-13  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* Makefile.am: Modify rules for i18n so that the catalogs are
	rebuilt only at install-time or explicitly, not during normal
	make.


2005/03/11: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug: Status of pending jobs are no longer set to "sent".


2005/03/09: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- safer handling of enqueued jobs upon ExecuteQueue:
  - when a job has been added to the queue of a backend it is moved from the
    "todo" list to the "sent" folder. This way even if the backend crashes a
    job will in no case be executed twice.
- AB_Banking_Save() now writes to temporary config file and renames the 
  resulting file later to the real name.
- clarified APIDOC of GetEnquedJobs and the function group it is in


2005/03/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in dtaus-import.c (reported by Andreas Degert)


2005/03/07: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------

- clarified APIDOC concerning accounts returned by various functions


2005/03/01: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- AB_Job now attaches to its account


2005/02/25: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------

- safer treatment of application and backend data files: write to temporary 
  file and rename to target later


2005/02/23: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- country.h: added missing statements for C++
- balance.c/h: argument t is now const

	* src/libs/aqbanking/types/value.h, value.c: Improve
	documentation. Add some additional predicate functions.

	* aqbanking.iss.in: Finally finish the iss setup file: The DLL is
	installed in the windows directory, the gwen plugins are installed
	in gwen's dbio-plugindir, everything else in the application's
	dir, and registry keys for querying its plugindir are set.


2005-02-21   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* aqbanking.iss.in: Add Inno Setup Compiler input file for
	automated creation of self-extracting Windows exe files. 

	* aqbanking-config.in.in, configure.ac: Clean up some variables so
	that the iss file can adapt this script at installation time.


2005/02/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added functions to AB_VALUE which will me allow later to use something
  other than double internally (add, sub, compare, isNegative)
- inserted country value 280 for Germany (since our official number is not
  really used. However, 276 is still around. But when asking for the number
  Germany the 280 will be returned because it preceeds 276 in my list)


2005/02/20: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- clarified API for AB_Banking_Print() to allow dry-runs and multi-page
  documents.

MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.4beta (2005/01/30)
===========================================================================


2005/01/30: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added function AB_Banking_GetSharedDataDir() which will be used by
  QBankManager and AqMoney3 to share their transaction storage. 
  However, other applications might want to share some of their data, too.

-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug in AB_Banking__ExecuteQueue() (was always returning an
  error)

  exist...


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.2beta (2005/01/22)
===========================================================================


2005/01/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added function AB_Provider_ResetQueue() to make sure no job is left in any
  backends' queue.
- now AqBanking guarantees that after AB_ExecuteQueue is called no job is
  left in any queue
- now even less verbous about entered PIN
- fixed a bug in pin management (was allowing a bad pin to be entered in a
  second try)
- added I18N stuff, added German translation


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.1beta (2005/01/22)
===========================================================================

  pin/tan
- fixed a bug in banking.c: Was saving status of all BUT bad pins


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 1.0.0beta (2005/01/14)
===========================================================================


2005/01/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added functions AB_Banking_FindWizard() and AB_Banking_FindDebugger()
- marked function AB_Banking_GetWizardPath() deprecated
- SWIFT and DTAUS DBIO parser no longer work with splits, therefore I will 
  have to prepare AB_TRANSACTIONs before exporting them with the DTAUS parser.
- AB_ImExporterAccountInfo() now returns const objects


2005/01/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added splits to AB_TRANSACTION. This way we can fully import file formats
  which contain splits


2005/01/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- future version numbers always use a level of 3 (even if the patchlevel is 0)


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.9 (2005/01/12)
===========================================================================


2005/01/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>

- now really fixed the bug I was hoping to have fixed on 2005/01/09


2005-01-11   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* aqbanking.spec.in: Add BuildRequires to ensure a sane rpm
	building environment.


2005/01/09: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug which could have occurred over year changes


2004/12/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed some bugs concerning UTF8/DTAUS/SWIFT/HBCI character set conversions
- bankinfo and provider plugins are now loaded using the GWEN_PLUGIN
  mechanism. Please note that all plugins will have to be adapted to this
  changes (AqHBCI already is). This needs the latest CVS version of GWEN.


2004/12/03: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added JobSingleDebitNote (still not supported by AqHBCI, that will
  follow)


2004/11/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added plugin for OpenHBCI1 config file (extracts transactions)
  Now importing transactions from an existing OpenHBCI1 config file
  works ;-)
  This change needs the latest Gwen CVS version (1.3.0.7)


2004/11/25: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added new CSV profile for AqMoney2 CSV files
- importing of AqMoney2 data now works !! ;-)


2004/11/23: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added properties to imexporter plugin descriptions ("import" and "export")
- added categories to AB_TRANSACTION
- removed account from AB_IMEXPORTER_ACCOUNTINFO (not needed)
- completed default profile for csv (export now works !! ;)


2004-11-22   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/plugins/bankinfo/de/de_p.h, de.c: Ifdef out when ktoblzcheck
	is not available.


2004/11/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added AB_BankInfoService (will extend the bank info code to include server
  settings for HBCI,  OFX, WebConnect etc)
  This needs the latest GWEN CVS version.
- extended API: Now AB_BANKINFO objects can be queried using templates.
  This allows to use any of the fields of a AB_BANKINFO object (except the
  service lists) for matching.
- bankinfo/de: now not only uses KtoBlzCheck, additionally uses the FinTS
  banklist file. This file also contains information about the HBCI version
  and servers.


2004/11/19: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added export-function to im/exporter
- started working on CSV exporter (needs latest Gwenhywfar CVS!)
- added new vars to im/exporter profiles: "import" and "export". These vars
  tell the application whether the profile can be used for import and/or
  export.


2004/11/18: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- parsers/swift/swift.c: 
  - fixed two bugs (spotted by Herbert.hbci@gmx.de, modified his patches):
    - removes artificial CR/LFs in :86: fields
    - now parses the last line of a SWIFT document
  - fixed loglevel (SWIFT log infos are no longer shown in red)
  - improved handling of umlauts in SWIFT documents (actually, SWIFT does not
    allow umlauts or any other special characters for that matter. However,
    banks send those character anyway, so we have to deal with them...
    This fix also handles English and French chars).


2004/11/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug spotted by Herbert Ellebruch


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.8 (2004/11/02)
===========================================================================


2004-10-30  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* aqbanking.spec.in: Added spec file for rpm creation.


2004/10/08: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added some user error codes


2004-10-03  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.h: Added
	AB_Banking_SetPinCacheEnabled function to allow the application to
	choose between per-session-caching (default) and
	only-per-queue-execution caching. Note: Need to increment
	SO_REVISION and SO_AGE because of that.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.7 (2004/09/28)
===========================================================================


2004/09/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- jobGetTransactions: fromDate and toDate are now const arguments


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.6 (2004/09/26)
===========================================================================


2004-09-25  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/types/value.c: When changing the locale,
	immediately copy the previous locale to a new buffer. Otherwise
	often enough the returned string which was static storage was no
	longer valid.

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: In any DelJob method, first check
	whether the name strings are non-NULL. Fixes crash when aborting
	the PIN dialog and still calling DelPendingJob afterwards.


2004/09/24: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a stupid bug in the code that reads a unique id


2004-09-24   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.c: Make the directory separator a
	macro so that correct paths are used on windows.

	* configure.ac: Introduce new AC_SUBST variable
	aqbanking_internal_libs that has the linker command without the
	lib directory.


2004/09/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added a GWEN_BufferedIO_Flush() to AB_Banking_GetUniqueId()
- AB_Banking__OpenFile: if error upon fcntl is ENOLCK it will be ignored.
  This is because locking is not supported on NFS files systems.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.5 (2004/09/19)
===========================================================================


2004/09/19: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- OFX importer: now stores check number and some other additional OFX fields
- parsers: now all parsers create UTF-8 data (surprisingly banks send SWIFT
  data which contains German umlauts)


2004/09/18: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- changed type of uniqueId in AB_Transaction
- added element FiId to transaction
- dropped country codes from transactions
- added elements localBranchId and remoteBranchId (for OFX)
- transactions handed over to JobGetTransaction get assigned a unique transfer
  id


2004/09/17: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added function AB_Banking_EnqueuePendingJobs()


2004/09/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added a note about the encodings used (UTF-8)
- consequent usage of UTF-8 in importer/exporter and parser plugins
- fixed a bug in SWIFT importer
- added error code AB_ERROR_ABORTED


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.4 (2004/09/15)
===========================================================================


2004/09/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- clarified documentation for the virtual user interaction functions regarding
  the code set to be used (and how to use HTML in the text)


2004/09/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed a bug (was falsely reporting a backend as active when in fact
  it wasn't)
- added OFX importer
- improved safety of unique id (it is now read from a file and written back 
  direclty after increment)
- the user data dir (normally $HOME/.banking) can now be set in the
  configuration file (but you should not that. Anyway, for very special 
  occasions - and I currently can't think of any - this might be usefull).
  This function has been added reluctantly on request.


2004/09/13: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- ImExporter API: added function to make an importer plugin check whether
  it supports a given file as data source
- replaced im/exporter DBIO by DTAUS and SWIFT


2004-09-10   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* configure.ac: Add ACX_WINDOWS_PATHS. Add dll rules all over the
	place.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.3 (2004/09/10)
===========================================================================


2004/09/09: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- banking: added functions which make it easier to retrieve the PIN or
  TAN for a given medium. These functions - if not overloaded - just
  use AB_Banking_InputBox() to get the pin/tan.
  These functions also keep track of the status of a pin. So if the
  backend requesting a pin plays along the built-in pin manager is able
  to take care of the pin status (e.g. refusing to return a PIN which is
  already known as being "bad"). This will facilitate building non-interactive
  programs.
  The PIN will be stored internally and returned for all following calls
  to the PIN getter function until the program is terminated. The PIN is
  not stored in a file. However, if the PIN has been marked as "bad" then
  an entry in the config-file is made. This entry consist of a name derived
  from the token and the value of the pin (concatenated and RMD160-hashed)
  and the status (only "bad" pins are saved since even if decoded they would
  be useless).
- changed the path for application and backend data in jobs (so that both
  types cannot interfere with each other)
- added support for account/bank checkers: the first country for which such
  a checker is available is "de" (Germany) using KtoBlzCheck.


2004/09/07: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- improved saving of backend data upon AB_Banking_Fini()
- added plugins for DTAUS and SWIFT (taken from AqHBCI)
- added AB_Banking_Save() on Christian's account


2004/09/03: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added missing checks to configure.ac (setlocale, locale.h)


2004-09-03   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/types/transaction.c: include config.h was
	missing, so update the generated code to the current typemaker's
	output.


===========================================================================
MARK: released AqBanking - 0.9.2 (2004/09/02)
===========================================================================


2004/09/02: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- prepared next release (revised API, additional high level API, bugfixes etc)
- AqBanking now works with KMyMoney


2004/08/30: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added conveniance functions to importer/exporter


2004/08/29: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- Valgrind-Session: fixed some memory leaks
- added application level API which should make it easier to add support for
  AqBanking to existing applications


2004/08/27: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added some lines to README


2004/08/26: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added two new queues: "deferred" and "archived".
  Jobs deleted from the "finished" queue are now stored in the "archived"
  directory.
  Jobs which have already been enqueued but not executed can now be
  deferred thus allowing to hold back some jobs without needing to remove
  them completely. You can later re-enqueue those jobs.


2004/08/25: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- changed the way AqBanking saves application/backend data, better data
  separation (as needed when temporarily shutting down a backend while
  setting it up with a wizard)
  -> previous configuration data gets lost with this change !!


2004/08/24: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- simplified importer/exporter framework: now an importer does no longer
  have to sort imported transactions by days. This must now be done inside
  an application, because sometimes this needs user interaction which is out
  of the scope of AqBanking
- fixed some bugs (e.g. was not using the data folder set bei ./configure)


2004/08/23: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added a generic import/export framework. This can be used to import
  any kind of financial file formats into AqBanking suitable data (like
  AB_TRANSACTION, AB_ACCOUNT etc).
- added AB_Banking_GetImExporterProfiles(). This function loads all profiles
  for an importer/exporter.


2004/08/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- AB_JOB: added functions which allow applications and backends to store
  specific data to a GWEN_DB within a job
- application names are now internally escaped to avoid security risks (since
  the application name is used to create file paths)
- application specific banking data is now stored in one file per application.
  This removes the need of loading the data for all applications on startup.
  Now only the data of the running application is loaded (in the long run
  this should keep the startup time short)
- boosted version to 0.9, since about 90 percent of the planned features
  are implemented
- provider names are now also escaped
- removed the import-transactions function from provider, this will be later
  added to a new function class which handled importing and exporting of
  AqBanking data


2004/08/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added currency to AB_ACCOUNT
- added functions to transaction which allows to clear purpose and remote
  name lists
- removed API-inconsistencies: since all *_fromSomething" functions basically
  are constructors they start with a lowercase letter after the prefixes
  (like in AB_Value_fromString() as in AB_Value_new()).


2004-08-21  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.h: Add AB_Banking_GetUserData and
	AB_Banking_SetUserData to pass data to the callbacks.


2004/08/20: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- created new LogDomain "aqbanking" (needs current Gwen CVS, though)


2004/08/19: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- changed the constructors for the getTransactions job
- added JOBSingleTransfer (performs a single transfer as you might have 
  guessed ;-)


2004/08/18: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- banking.c: 
  - changed loading of job queues. They are now stored one file per job in 
    special folders:
    - "todo"    : enqueued jobs
    - "finished": finished jobs (moved to there from "todo")
    - "pending" : pending jobs (moved to there from "todo")


2004/08/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- created new header files for backend development (contain prototypes
  for functions which are only to be used by the library itself and
  backends. Might be published in special RPMs especially dedicated to
  backend development).
- added AB_Transaction_fromDb() and AB_Transaction_toDb()
- AB_Banking_GetProvider: initialize the provider after loading it


2004/08/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added AB_Transaction_dup()
- added functions which allow the library to completely load jobs from
  a db (improves the previous job loading features)
- started implementing JOBGetTransactions


===========================================================================
MARK: released aqbanking-0.1.2alpha (2004/08/13)
===========================================================================


2004-08-13   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking++/aqbankingpp.vcproj: Add project file for
	compiling aqbanking++ with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC)
	compiler.


2004/08/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- aqbanking:
  - removed AB_ProviderWizard. A Wizard is now a stand-alone executable so 
    there is no need for dynamically loading a module
  - banking: 
    - added functions which allow to temporarily suspend backends. This
      is needed while a setup wizard is executed
    - made some functions private to AqBanking
    - added AB_Banking_GetWizardPath() which returns the folder where 
      executable wizards for a given backend are located
  - provider: added functions to init and deinit backends
- aqbanking++: removed provider files, because the ProviderWizard no longer
  exists



===========================================================================
MARK: released aqbanking-0.1.1alpha (2004/08/11)
===========================================================================



2004-08-10   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/*.h: Add AQBANKING_API to all function
	declarations.
	
	* src/libs/aqbanking/error.h: Add declaration of
	__declspec(dllimport/export) macro AQBANKING_API, depending on
	BUILDING_AQBANKING_DLL.


2004/08/09: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- declared UI methods in AB::Banking public
- added a flags parameter to AB_Banking_ShowBox()
- adapted to latest changes in Gwen


2004/08/06: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- aqbanking++: added class for ProviderWizards
- fixed some bugs
- launching a wizard now works !!! ;-)
  I will have to concentrate now on the kde_wizard for AqHBCI to allow people
  to later move over to AqHBCI/AqBanking ;-)

	* many headers: Remove trailing semicolon from macro calls as

-------------------------------------------------
- fixed some bugs, added some functions to AB_JOB


2004/08/04: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- completed API documentation for AB_BANKING
- fixed AB_Transaction (was missing textkey)


2004/08/03: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- banking/banking.{c,h}: AB_Banking_MessageBox: Just figured out that for 
    non-interactive frontends there is more information to be supplied. 
    I also reordered the arguments so that they look like those of 
    AB_Banking_InputBox.

	* src/libs/aqbanking/Makefile.am,
	src/libs/aqbanking/ressource.rc.in, configure.ac: Add build rules
	for windows DLL, copied from gwenhywfar.


2004/08/02: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- very much improved generation of API doc. In combination with the
  changes in my other projects the new target "install-srcdoc" now
  creates combined API docs (e.g. API doc for AqBanking now links to
  that of Gwenhywfar etc)
- now uses gwen's new tool mklistdoc to generate list documentation suitable
  for doxygen. Needs the latest CVS version of Gwen.


2004/08/01: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- adapted to latest changes in AqHBCI and Gwen.
- fixed some bugs


2004/07/31: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- improved configure.ac
- added c++ binding
- cleaned up the code, moved some functions to private headers
- started with APIDOC
