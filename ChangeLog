2004/08/22: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- AB_JOB: added functions which allow applications and backends to store
  specific data to a GWEN_DB within a job


2004/08/21: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added currency to AB_ACCOUNT
- added functions to transaction which allows to clear purpose and remote
  name lists
- removed API-inconsistencies: since all *_fromSomething" functions basically
  are constructors they start with a lowercase letter after the prefixes
  (like in AB_Value_fromString() as in AB_Value_new()).


2004-08-21  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/banking.h: Add AB_Banking_GetUserData and
	AB_Banking_SetUserData to pass data to the callbacks.


2004/08/20: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- created new LogDomain "aqbanking" (needs current Gwen CVS, though)


2004/08/19: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- changed the constructors for the getTransactions job
- added JOBSingleTransfer (performs a single transfer as you might have 
  guessed ;-)


2004/08/18: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- banking.c: 
  - changed loading of job queues. They are now stored one file per job in 
    special folders:
    - "todo"    : enqueued jobs
    - "finished": finished jobs (moved to there from "todo")
    - "pending" : pending jobs (moved to there from "todo")


2004/08/15: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- created new header files for backend development (contain prototypes
  for functions which are only to be used by the library itself and
  backends. Might be published in special RPMs especially dedicated to
  backend development).
- added AB_Transaction_fromDb() and AB_Transaction_toDb()
- AB_Banking_GetProvider: initialize the provider after loading it


2004/08/14: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- added AB_Transaction_dup()
- added functions which allow the library to completely load jobs from
  a db (improves the previous job loading features)
- started implementing JOBGetTransactions


===========================================================================
MARK: released aqbanking-0.1.2alpha (2004/08/13)
===========================================================================


2004-08-13   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking++/aqbankingpp.vcproj: Add project file for
	compiling aqbanking++ with Microsoft Visual Studio C++ (MSVC)
	compiler.


2004/08/12: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- aqbanking:
  - removed AB_ProviderWizard. A Wizard is now a stand-alone executable so 
    there is no need for dynamically loading a module
  - banking: 
    - added functions which allow to temporarily suspend backends. This
      is needed while a setup wizard is executed
    - made some functions private to AqBanking
    - added AB_Banking_GetWizardPath() which returns the folder where 
      executable wizards for a given backend are located
  - provider: added functions to init and deinit backends
- aqbanking++: removed provider files, because the ProviderWizard no longer
  exists



===========================================================================
MARK: released aqbanking-0.1.1alpha (2004/08/11)
===========================================================================



2004-08-10   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/*.h: Add AQBANKING_API to all function
	declarations.
	
	* src/libs/aqbanking/error.h: Add declaration of
	__declspec(dllimport/export) macro AQBANKING_API, depending on
	BUILDING_AQBANKING_DLL.


2004/08/09: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- declared UI methods in AB::Banking public
- added a flags parameter to AB_Banking_ShowBox()
- adapted to latest changes in Gwen


2004/08/06: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- aqbanking++: added class for ProviderWizards
- fixed some bugs
- launching a wizard now works !!! ;-)
  I will have to concentrate now on the kde_wizard for AqHBCI to allow people
  to later move over to AqHBCI/AqBanking ;-)


2004-08-02   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* many headers: Remove trailing semicolon from macro calls as
	required by ISO C89.

	
2004/08/05: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- fixed some bugs, added some functions to AB_JOB


2004/08/04: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- completed API documentation for AB_BANKING
- fixed AB_Transaction (was missing textkey)


2004/08/03: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- banking/banking.{c,h}: AB_Banking_MessageBox: Just figured out that for 
    non-interactive frontends there is more information to be supplied. 
    I also reordered the arguments so that they look like those of 
    AB_Banking_InputBox.


2004-08-02   Christian Stimming <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/libs/aqbanking/Makefile.am,
	src/libs/aqbanking/ressource.rc.in, configure.ac: Add build rules
	for windows DLL, copied from gwenhywfar.


2004/08/02: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- very much improved generation of API doc. In combination with the
  changes in my other projects the new target "install-srcdoc" now
  creates combined API docs (e.g. API doc for AqBanking now links to
  that of Gwenhywfar etc)
- now uses gwen's new tool mklistdoc to generate list documentation suitable
  for doxygen. Needs the latest CVS version of Gwen.


2004/08/01: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- adapted to latest changes in AqHBCI and Gwen.
- fixed some bugs


2004/07/31: Martin Preuss<martin@libchipcard.de>
-------------------------------------------------
- improved configure.ac
- added c++ binding
- cleaned up the code, moved some functions to private headers
- started with APIDOC
