===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.3.0beta (2005/07/15)
===========================================================================

This release now includes all backends (AqHBCI, AqDTAUS, AqGeldKarte,
AqOfxConnect) and all frontends (console, gtk2, qt3, kde3) and all QT3
setup wizards for all backends.
AqHBCI now uses Gwenhywfar's CryptToken plugins instead of its own media
plugins. "aqhbci-tool" can now be used to setup a new user from console.
An ERI importer plugin has been added, some important bugs have been fixed
and code duplication has been replaced by the new QT3 frontend.

Please note that the media plugins for AqHBCI (DDVCard, RSACard) are now 
obsoleted by the latest versions of AqBanking, Gwen and Libchipcard2.
