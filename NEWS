===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.3.0beta (2005/07/15)
===========================================================================

This release now includes all backends (AqHBCI, AqDTAUS,
AqGeldKarte, AqOfxConnect) and all frontends (console, gtk2, qt3,
kde3) and all QT3 setup wizards for all backends.  AqHBCI now uses
Gwenhywfar's CryptToken plugins instead of its own media
plugins. "aqhbci-tool" can now be used to setup a new user from
console.  An ERI importer plugin has been added, some important
bugs have been fixed and code duplication has been replaced by the
new QT3 frontend. (Note: Further information in German can be
found on http://linuxwiki.de/AqBanking )

Please note that the media plugins for AqHBCI (DDVCard, RSACard)
are now obsoleted by the latest versions of AqBanking, Gwen and
Libchipcard2.
