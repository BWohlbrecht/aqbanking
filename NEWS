===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.9.0beta (2006-01-11)
===========================================================================

This version features a complete redesign of the configuration framework.
It also removes some deprecated functions and makes use of GCCs visibility
feature (thus removing several hundred symbols from the libraries export
table which decreases application loading time).


===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.8.1beta (2005-12-15)
===========================================================================

This version fixes some network problems and cleans up the build system.
It now allows to choose the transfer mode independantly for transfer orders
and debit notes.


===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.8.0beta (2005-11-22)
===========================================================================

This version fixes many bugs, adapts to Gwenhywfar2 (1.99.0) and fixes
many problems encountered in HBCI-PIN/TAN mode. The user setup wizard for
HBCI has been rewritten (but it can only import existing media for now).


===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.6.0beta (2005/09/02)
===========================================================================

This release fixes some bugs and adds job-related logging (to be viewed with
aqbanking-tool's new command "joblog").


===========================================================================
               Released AqBanking - 1.3.0beta (2005/07/15)
===========================================================================

This release now includes all backends (AqHBCI, AqDTAUS,
AqGeldKarte, AqOfxConnect) and all frontends (console, gtk2, qt3,
kde3) and all QT3 setup wizards for all backends.  AqHBCI now uses
Gwenhywfar's CryptToken plugins instead of its own media
plugins. "aqhbci-tool" can now be used to setup a new user from
console.  An ERI importer plugin has been added, some important
bugs have been fixed and code duplication has been replaced by the
new QT3 frontend. (Note: Further information in German can be
found on http://linuxwiki.de/AqBanking )

Please note that the media plugins for AqHBCI (DDVCard, RSACard)
are now obsoleted by the latest versions of AqBanking, Gwen and
Libchipcard2.
